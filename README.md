# Dominance Analysis for Accurate and Intuitive Relative Importance of Predictors

*This package is designed for regression task where-in provided with a dataset and continous target variable, the package returns the Incremental R-Square that any variable will add to total R-Square of the model. As the complexity of the algorithm increases with number of features, we have in-built functionality that chooses the <b>K=15</b> best features from all the estimators and returns incremental R-Square each variable all to the total R-Square of the model.*

## PSEUDO R-Square for Classification Task / Logistic Regression

### 1. McFadden's Pseudo-R Square

Logistic regression models are fitted using the method of maximum likelihood - i.e. the parameter estimates are those values which maximize the likelihood of the data which have been observed. McFadden's R squared measure is defined as

$$R_{McFadden}^{2} = 1- \frac{log(L_c)}{log(L_{null})}$$

where \$L_c\$ denotes the (maximized) likelihood value from the current fitted model, and $ L_{null} $ denotes the corresponding value but for the null model - the model with only an intercept and no covariates.

### 2. Nagelkerke Pseudo-R Square

### 3. Cox and Snell R-Square

### 4. Estrella R-Square
